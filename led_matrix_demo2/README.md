# Demonstration code 2
## By Fabien Batteix (alias SkyWodd)

Demonstration code using AVR registers access and some optimization tricks.
Nearly identical to the demonstration code 1 but without any Arduino crap anymore.

No too bad performances (5KHz refresh max). Usable for "real applications".

Please take a look at the demonstration code 3 (coming soon) for a little more optimized version (yes again).

# Demonstration code 3
## By Fabien Batteix (alias SkyWodd)

Demonstration code using AVR registers access and lot of optimization tricks.
Memory organisation is optimised for fast read access and not-too-slow write acces.

Refresh routine execution time: 214µs (4.66KHz).
Recommended code for "real application" usage.

Take a look at the "m1284p" version for a much more optimized version for use with an ATmega1284p mcu.

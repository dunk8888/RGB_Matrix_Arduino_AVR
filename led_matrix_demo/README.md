# Demonstration code 1
## By Fabien Batteix (alias SkyWodd)

Demonstration code using only the Arduino API functions. Nothing else.
Very slow, not usable for "real applications", but perfect to demonstrate how the code work internaly.

Refresh routine execution time: 2.66ms (376Hz).
This one is for educational purpose only.

Please take a look at the demonstration code 2 for a more optimized version.

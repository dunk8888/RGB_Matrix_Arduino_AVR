# Demonstration code 1
## By Fabien Batteix (alias SkyWodd)

Demonstration code using only the Arduino API functions. Nothing else.
Very slow, not usable for "real applications", but perfect to demonstrate how the code work internaly.

Please take a look at the demonstration code 2 for a little more optimized version.

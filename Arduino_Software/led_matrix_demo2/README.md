# Demonstration code 2
## By Fabien Batteix (alias SkyWodd)

Demonstration code using AVR registers access and some optimization tricks.
Nearly identical to the demonstration code 1 but without any Arduino crap anymore.

Refresh routine execution time: 408µs (2.45KHz).
Usable for "real applications" (but not really recommended).

Please take a look at the demonstration code 3 for a more optimized version.
